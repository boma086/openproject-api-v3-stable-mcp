# OpenProjectApiV3Stable\_ MCP 1.0.0

Welcome to the OpenProjectApiV3Stable* MCP documentation. This guide will help you get started with integrating and using the OpenProjectApiV3Stable* MCP in your client.

## Versions

- MCP version: `1.0.0`

## About the API

You're looking at the current **stable** documentation of the OpenProject APIv3. If you're interested in the current
development version, please go to [github.com/opf](https://github.com/opf/openproject/tree/dev/docs/api/apiv3).

## Introduction

The documentation for the APIv3 is written according to the [OpenAPI 3.1 Specification](https://swagger.io/specification/).
You can either view the static version of this documentation on the [website](https://www.openproject.org/docs/api/introduction/)
or the interactive version, rendered with [OpenAPI Explorer](https://github.com/Rhosys/openapi-explorer/blob/main/README.md),
in your OpenProject installation under `/api/docs`.
In the latter you can try out the various API endpoints directly interacting with our OpenProject data.
Moreover you can access the specification source itself under `/api/v3/spec.json` and `/api/v3/spec.yml`
(e.g. [here](https://community.openproject.org/api/v3/spec.yml)).

The APIv3 is a hypermedia REST API, a shorthand for "Hypermedia As The Engine Of Application State" (HATEOAS).
This means that each endpoint of this API will have links to other resources or actions defined in the resulting body.

These related resources and actions for any given resource will be context sensitive. For example, only actions that the
authenticated user can take are being rendered. This can be used to dynamically identify actions that the user might take for any
given response.

As an example, if you fetch a work package through the [Work Package endpoint](https://www.openproject.org/docs/api/endpoints/work-packages/), the `update` link will only
be present when the user you authenticated has been granted a permission to update the work package in the assigned project.

## HAL+JSON

HAL is a simple format that gives a consistent and easy way to hyperlink between resources in your API.
Read more in the following specification: [https://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-kelly-json-hal-08](https://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-kelly-json-hal-08)

**OpenProject API implementation of HAL+JSON format** enriches JSON and introduces a few meta properties:

- `_type` - specifies the type of the resource (e.g.: WorkPackage, Project)
- `_links` - contains all related resource and action links available for the resource
- `_embedded` - contains all embedded objects

HAL does not guarantee that embedded resources are embedded in their full representation, they might as well be
partially represented (e.g. some properties can be left out).
However in this API you have the guarantee that whenever a resource is **embedded**, it is embedded in its **full representation**.

## API response structure

All API responses contain a single HAL+JSON object, even collections of objects are technically represented by
a single HAL+JSON object that itself contains its members. More details on collections can be found
in the [Collections Section](https://www.openproject.org/docs/api/collections/).

## Authentication

The API supports the following authentication schemes: OAuth2, session based authentication, and basic auth.

Depending on the settings of the OpenProject instance many resources can be accessed without being authenticated.
In case the instance requires authentication on all requests the client will receive an **HTTP 401** status code
in response to any request.

Otherwise unauthenticated clients have all the permissions of the anonymous user.

### Session-based Authentication

This means you have to login to OpenProject via the Web-Interface to be authenticated in the API.
This method is well-suited for clients acting within the browser, like the Angular-Client built into OpenProject.

In this case, you always need to pass the HTTP header `X-Requested-With "XMLHttpRequest"` for authentication.

### API Key through Basic Auth

Users can authenticate towards the API v3 using basic auth with the user name `apikey` (NOT your login) and the API key as the password.
Users can find their API key on their account page.

Example:

```shell
API_KEY=2519132cdf62dcf5a66fd96394672079f9e9cad1
curl -u apikey:$API_KEY https://community.openproject.org/api/v3/users/42
```

### OAuth2.0 authentication

OpenProject allows authentication and authorization with OAuth2 with _Authorization code flow_, as well as _Client credentials_ operation modes.

To get started, you first need to register an application in the OpenProject OAuth administration section of your installation.
This will save an entry for your application with a client unique identifier (`client_id`) and an accompanying secret key (`client_secret`).

You can then use one the following guides to perform the supported OAuth 2.0 flows:

- [Authorization code flow](https://oauth.net/2/grant-types/authorization-code)

- [Authorization code flow with PKCE](https://doorkeeper.gitbook.io/guides/ruby-on-rails/pkce-flow), recommended for clients unable to keep the client_secret confidential

- [Client credentials](https://oauth.net/2/grant-types/client-credentials/) - Requires an application to be bound to an impersonating user for non-public access

### OIDC provider generated JWT as a Bearer token

There is a possibility to use JSON Web Tokens (JWT) generated by an OIDC provider configured in OpenProject as a bearer token to do authenticated requests against the API.
The following requirements must be met:

- OIDC provider must be configured in OpenProject with **jwks_uri**
- JWT must be signed using RSA algorithm
- JWT **iss** claim must be equal to OIDC provider **issuer**
- JWT **aud** claim must contain the OpenProject **client ID** used at the OIDC provider
- JWT **scope** claim must include a valid scope to access the desired API (e.g. `api_v3` for APIv3)
- JWT must be actual (neither expired or too early to be used)
- JWT must be passed in Authorization header like: `Authorization: Bearer {jwt}`
- User from **sub** claim must be logged in OpenProject before otherwise it will be not authenticated

In more general terms, OpenProject should be compliant to [RFC 9068](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc9068) when validating access tokens.

### Why not username and password?

The simplest way to do basic auth would be to use a user's username and password naturally.
However, OpenProject already has supported API keys in the past for the API v2, though not through basic auth.

Using **username and password** directly would have some advantages:

- It is intuitive for the user who then just has to provide those just as they would when logging into OpenProject.

- No extra logic for token management necessary.

On the other hand using **API keys** has some advantages too, which is why we went for that:

- If compromised while saved on an insecure client the user only has to regenerate the API key instead of changing their password, too.

- They are naturally long and random which makes them invulnerable to dictionary attacks and harder to crack in general.

Most importantly users may not actually have a password to begin with. Specifically when they have registered
through an OpenID Connect provider.

## Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS)

By default, the OpenProject API is _not_ responding with any CORS headers.
If you want to allow cross-domain AJAX calls against your OpenProject instance, you need to enable CORS headers being returned.

Please see [our API settings documentation](https://www.openproject.org/docs/system-admin-guide/api-and-webhooks/) on
how to selectively enable CORS.

## Allowed HTTP methods

- `GET` - Get a single resource or collection of resources

- `POST` - Create a new resource or perform

- `PATCH` - Update a resource

- `DELETE` - Delete a resource

## Compression

Responses are compressed if requested by the client. Currently [gzip](https://www.gzip.org/) and [deflate](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc1951)
are supported. The client signals the desired compression by setting the [`Accept-Encoding` header](https://www.w3.org/Protocols/rfc2616/rfc2616-sec14.html#sec14.3).
If no `Accept-Encoding` header is send, `Accept-Encoding: identity` is assumed which will result in the API responding uncompressed.

# Setup & Configuration

## Local usage requirements

To get started with the MCP, we recommend installing [npm](https://docs.npmjs.com/downloading-and-installing-node-js-and-npm)

## Steps to run it locally

1. Open a terminal, go to the root folder of this project and run the command:

```bash
npm run setup
```

This command will establish a linkage between the MCP server and the SDK, install the required dependencies, and compile the project.

2. Copy this object into the MCP configuration file in your client:

```bash
    {
        "mcpServers": {
            "liblab": {
                "command": "node",
                "args": [
                    "YOUR_FOLDER_ROOT_PATH/dist/index.js"
                ]
            }
        }
    }
```

Substitute "YOUR_FOLDER_ROOT_PATH" with the absolute path to the directory containing the MCP server.

## Use arguments

```bash
    {
        "mcpServers": {
            "liblab": {
                "command": "node",
                "args": [
                    "YOUR_FOLDER_ROOT_PATH/dist/index.js"
                ],
                "env": {
                        "BASE_URL": "YOUR_SECRET_VALUE_HERE",
                        "PASSWORD": "YOUR_SECRET_VALUE_HERE",
                        "USERNAME": "YOUR_SECRET_VALUE_HERE",
                }
            }
        }
    }
```

## Environment Variables

These are the environment variables for the MCP:

| Name     | Description                           |
| :------- | :------------------------------------ |
| BASE_URL | Optional - Base URL for the API.      |
| PASSWORD | Password required for authentication. |
| USERNAME | Username required for authentication. |

Environment variables are a way to configure your application outside the code.

You will have to configure these variables in your client configuration file.

## Tools

The MCP includes several tools that represent the data structures used in API requests and responses. These tools help in organizing and managing the data efficiently.

| create_attachment                              | Clients can create attachments without a container first and attach them later on. This is useful if the container does not exist at the time the attachment is uploaded. After the upload, the client can then claim such containerless attachments for any resource eligible e.g. WorkPackage on subsequent requests. The upload and the claiming must be done for the same user account. Attachments uploaded by another user cannot be claimed and once claimed for a resource, they cannot be claimed by another. The upload request must be of type multipartform-data with exactly two parts. The first part must be called metadata. Its content type is expected to be applicationjson, the body must be a single JSON object, containing at least the fileName and optionally the attachments description. The second part must be called file, its content type should match the mime type of the file. The body must be the raw content of the file. Note that a filename must be indicated in the Content-Disposition of this part, although it will be ignored. Instead the fileName inside the JSON of the metadata part will be used. |

| create_work_package_attachment                 | To add an attachment to a work package, a client needs to issue a request of type multipartform-data with exactly two parts. The first part must be called metadata. Its content type is expected to be applicationjson, the body must be a single JSON object, containing at least the fileName and optionally the attachments description. The second part must be called file, its content type should match the mime type of the file. The body must be the raw content of the file. Note that a filename must be indicated in the Content-Disposition of this part, however it will be ignored. Instead the fileName inside the JSON of the metadata part will be used.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |

| get_custom_field_items                         | Retrieves the hierarchy of custom fields. The hierarchy is a tree structure of hierarchy items. It is represented as a flat list of items, where each item has a reference to its parent and children. The list is ordered in a depth-first manner. The first item is the requested parent. If parent was unset, the root item is returned as first element. Passing the depth query parameter allows to limit the depth of the hierarchy. If the depth is unset, the full hierarchy tree is returned. If the depth is set to 0, only the requested parent is returned. Any other positive integer will return the number of children levels specified by this value. This endpoint only returns, if the custom field is of type hierarchy.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |

| create_storage                                 | Creates a storage resource. When creating a storage, a confidential OAuth 2 provider application is created automatically. The oauth client id and secret of the created OAuth application are returned in the response. IMPORTANT This is the only time, the oauth client secret is visible to the consumer. After that, the secret is hidden. To update the storage with OAuth client credentials, which enable the storage resource to behave as an OAuth 2 client against an external OAuth 2 provider application, another request must be made to create those, see POST apiv3storagesidoauthclientcredentials.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |

| get_storage_files                              | Gets a collection of files from a storage. If no parent context is given, the result is the content of the document root. With parent context given, the result contains the collections of filesdirectories from within the given parent file id. If given parent context is no directory, 400 Bad Request is returned.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |
| prepare_storage_file_upload                    | Executes a request that prepares a link for a direct upload to the storage.

By providing a notificationMessage within the meta block of the payload, the client can include a customized message to the user of the newly created membership. In case of a group, the message will be sent to every user belonging to the group. By including \"sendNotifications\" false within the meta block of the payload, no notifications is send out at all.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |

| list_notifications                             | Returns the collection of available in-app notifications. The notifications returned depend on the provided parameters and also on the requesting user's permissions.

| list_available_parent_project_candidates       | Lists projects which can become parent to another project. Only sound candidates are returned. For instance a project cannot become parent of itself or its children. To specify the project for which a parent is queried for, the of parameter can be provided. If no of parameter is provided, a new project is assumed. Then, the check for the hierarchy is omitted as a new project cannot be part of a hierarchy yet. Candidates can be filtered. Most commonly one will want to filter by name or identifier. You can do this through the filters parameter which works just like the work package index.

For instance, when sending \"startDate\" \"2022-08-23\", duration \"P2D\" , the response will include \"dueDate\" \"2022-08-24\" .                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |

| list_work_package_file_links                   | Gets all file links of a work package. As a side effect, for every file link a request is sent to the storage's origin to fetch live data and patch the file link's data before returning, as well as retrieving permissions of the user on this origin file.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |
| create_work_package_file_link                  | Creates file links on a work package. The request is interpreted as a bulk insert, where every element of the collection is validated separately. Each element contains the origin meta data and a link to the storage, the file link is about to point to. The storage link can be provided as a resource link with id or as the host url. The file's id and name are considered mandatory information. The rest of the origin meta data SHOULD be provided by the client. The mimeType SHOULD be a standard mime type. An empty mime type will be handled as unknown. To link a folder, the custom mime type applicationx-op-directory MUST be used. Up to 20 file links can be submitted at once. If any element data is invalid, no file links will be created. If a file link with matching origin id, work package, and storage already exists, then it will not create an additional file link or update the meta data. Instead the information from the existing file link will be returned.                                                                                                                                                  |
| form_edit_work_package                         | When calling this endpoint, the client provides a single object containing the properties and links to be edited, in the body. The input is validated and a schema response is returned. If the validation errors of the response is empty, the same payload can be used to edit the work package. Only the properties of the work package write model are allowed to set on a work package on editing. When setting start date, finish date, and duration together, their correctness will be checked and a validation error will be returned if one value does not match with the two others. You can make the server compute a value set only two values in the request and the third one will be computed and returned in the response. For instance, when sending \"startDate\" \"2022-08-23\", duration \"P2D\" , the response will include \"dueDate\" \"2022-08-24\" .                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |

| update_relation                                | When calling this endpoint the client provides a single object, containing the properties and links that it wants to change, in the body. It is only allowed to provide properties or links supporting the write operation. Note that changing the type of a relation invariably also changes the respective reverseType as well as the \"name\" of it. The returned Relation object will reflect that change. For instance if you change a Relation's type to \"follows\" then the reverseType will be changed to precedes. It is not allowed to change a relation's involved work packages.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |

| create_views                                   | When calling this endpoint the client provides a single object, containing at least the properties and links that are required, in the body. The required fields of a View can be found in its schema, which is embedded in the respective form. Note that it is only allowed to provide properties or links supporting the write operation. There are different subtypes of Views e.g. ViewsWorkPackagesTable with each having its own endpoint for creating that subtype e.g. apiv3viewsworkpackagestable for ViewsWorkPackagesTable apiv3viewsteamplanner for ViewsTeamPlanner apiv3viewsworkpackagescalendar for ViewsWorkPackagesCalendar Not yet implemented To get the list of available subtypes and by that the endpoints for creating a subtype, use the apiv3viewsschemas endpoint.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |
